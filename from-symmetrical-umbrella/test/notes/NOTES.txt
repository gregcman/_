;;;[ function call + data ] vs funcallable closure
;;;conclusion: stay away from closures if fast code, inlining with no function
;;;overhead, no float boxing on x86 on sbcl, is what is wanted. use vectors?
;;;instead? but what about structs? vectors = fast and flexible, but lambdas
;;;are also flexible? but flexible often means weak - flexibility comes at the
;;;price of strength and vice versa?
